## Category 6: YouTube Shorts (0 of 2)

*"The 2 puzzles on YouTube shorts that aren't related to the gifts."*

| # | Location | Video | Decode | Confidence |
|---|----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ??? | "Mirror mirror on the wall" short (8_aIjKi0VLM) | "Rewatch This Video to Win $1,000,000" — hallway video with doors, characters, movements. Extensive analysis of door paths, red key cow, basketball teams, bear saying "HECK", boxers, twins, 6 red butler doors at end. | Unsolved |
| 2 | ??? | Chocolate heart short (XbaZ45LVzzM / nJh_RlvAMS8) | "Surprising My Fiancée With A Chocolate Heart" — MrBeast + Amaury Gaichon make giant chocolate heart with smaller red/silver hearts inside. Connected to Jim/Monika gift puzzle (heart theme, break hearts). May also connect to "School of Athens" MrBeast replica painting short. | Unsolved |

**Key Evidence:**
- **Short 1 (Mirror mirror):** youtube.com/shorts/8_aIjKi0VLM — 8 doors (4 pairs), characters tracked through mirrored paths: cow with red key (A→a), basketball teams (red #20/23/25, blue), bear with "HECK" in red, twins (no movement), boxers, ref, flame jugglers, hoop, 6 red butler doors at end.
- **Short 2 (Chocolate heart):** youtube.com/shorts/XbaZ45LVzzM or youtube.com/shorts/nJh_RlvAMS8 (two video IDs for same/similar content) — MrBeast + Amaury Guichon make giant chocolate heart with smaller red/silver hearts inside. Connects to Jim/Monika gift puzzle (heart theme).
- **Confirmation:** Hint #6 (Feb 14) from puka/LSG: "The 2 puzzles on YouTube shorts that aren't related to the gifts." — confirms exactly 2 shorts, distinct from the 10 gift-related influencer videos.
- **Possible 3rd candidate (less likely):** "School of Athens" replica painting short — Fynecs (LSG Discord, Feb 14) references "the youtube short, the Mr. Beast replica painting" in context of Versace/Medusa/Greek symbolism theory. May be same as chocolate heart short or separate.
- **Deleted video theory:** Slack user U0AFQ2U5H40 (Feb 14): "did anyone else see the youtube short after the SB that was deleted the next day? I have a couple screen shots, its an alternate video of the hallway video just different." May be alternate cut of Short 1 or entirely different puzzle.
