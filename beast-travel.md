## Boat (91 rows — vehicle-color substitution cipher)

*"You can fill in all the spaces / And take a boat to all these places / You'll find our transports shown within / They'll give you all you need to win"*

The boat page shows 91 rows of white squares with occasional colored vehicle icons (boats, cars, horses, planes). Each row represents a Stage 1 location in "City Country" format (or state/province for US/Canada). The vehicle icons replace specific letters.

### Vehicle-Color Cipher

**Discovery:** Each (color, vehicle) combination *always* replaces the same letter — a simple substitution cipher. Verified across 50/51 confirmed rows with zero exceptions.

| Vehicle | Brown | Gold | Green | Purple | Silver | Black | Blue | Red | Yellow |
|---------|-------|------|-------|--------|--------|-------|------|-----|--------|
| **Boat** | A | E | S | T | R | — | — | — | — |
| **Car** | — | — | B | M | — | Y | C | I | U |
| **Horse** | — | — | V | G | — | K | D | H | W |
| **Plane** | — | — | N | L | — | F | J | O | P |

### Decoded Message (91 letters)

Reading the cipher letter from each row in order spells:

> **IN JIMMY'S VAULT, FIRST PART STICKS ROAMY RESULTS IN BETWEEN STAGE ONE ANSWER PAIRS. LAST PART HE SHOWED AT START.**

**Interpretation:**
1. **FIRST PART:** Interleave ("stick") the beast.travel ("Roamy") results in between Stage One answer pairs
2. **LAST PART:** Something "he showed at the start" (beginning of commercial/video)

### Grid Status

- **91 total rows:** 15 Car + 9 Horse + 16 Plane + 51 Boat
- **52 rows** matched to known Stage 1 destinations
- **39 rows** letter known from cipher only (destination unknown)
- **50/51** confirmed destinations match their cipher letter perfectly
- **1 exception:** Row 16 (7+7, Silver-Boat=R) — no known destination fits

### Notable Cipher Findings

- **Tampa Bay (not Tampa):** "TAMPA BAY FLORIDA" (5+3+7) fits row 63 — Silver-Boat at pos 12 of FLORIDA = R. ✓ Previously assumed "TAMPA FLORIDA" (5+7) at row 17, which conflicted with cipher (Green-Boat=S ≠ T).
- **Kandi, Benin conflict:** Row 75 (5+4+7) requires R at pos 8, but KANDI BENIN gives uncertain fit. Location may be wrong.
- **~~Babylon no-fit~~:** Superseded — FAQ answer is now Gaborone, Botswana (8+8 → row 8, S ✓). Babylon had no grid fit.
- **4 car cities don't fit:** Maiduguri (9+7), Winnipeg (8+8), Nantucket (9+13), Mayotte (7+6) match no car row. 4 car rows remain open: Row 6 (7, M@1), Row 7 (5+5, Y@10), Row 32 (5+9, M@1), Row 37 (4+7, U@2).
- **3 plane format issues:** Derby (5+9), Hasik (5+4), Tacurong (8+11) don't match open plane rows 14 (5+10+4), 38 (5+5+9), 64 (8+3+11). GeoGuessr locations confirmed but beast.travel name format uncertain.

## Other Notes

- **Lords of Vegas carousel:** 6 colors (Black, Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple) cycle on each page. Function unknown — may relate to ordering.
- **Image captions vary** — "Join us at," "See lovely," "Meet us at," etc. Could be extraction keys.
- **"Winning combination"** — homepage tagline. May signal combinatorial puzzle mechanic.
- **Boat names:** THE SPHINX (yellow), THE PIONEER (brown), THE VEGA (green), THE ALBION (purple), THE TIVOLI (white/silver). Last one identified by will.i.ham (Feb 20).
