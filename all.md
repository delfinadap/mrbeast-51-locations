*Note: 51 puzzle slots above + crossword = 51 locations + 1 crossword. CASABLANCA (Slack emoji) is confirmed as a location but its category slot is uncertain — Slack is a Salesforce product but not clearly one of Hint #9's 9. Other confirmed puzzles (Cow, Bear, Flamethrower, Lock) exist but their category assignment is unclear — some may be YouTube Shorts (Category 6) rather than Salesforce (Category 7).*
