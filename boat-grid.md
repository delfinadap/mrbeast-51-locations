## Grid Conflicts

These destinations have been identified but **don't fit any row** on the grid:

### Car cities (4 wrong — need 4 new cities)

| Puzzle | Current city | Lengths | Problem | Open row it should fill |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|------------------------|
| FURFURACEOUS | Maiduguri, Nigeria | 9+7 | No 9+7 car row | Row 6 (7, M@1), Row 7 (5+5, Y@10), Row 32 (5+9, M@1), or Row 37 (4+7, U@2) |
| HEKISTOTHERM | Winnipeg, Canada | 8+8 | No 8+8 car row | (same 4 open rows) |
| SALAMANDROID | Nantucket, MA | 9+13 | No 9+13 car row | Row 7 most likely (Genoa Italy fits grid but not nickname) |
| SCAPULOMANCY | Mayotte, France | 7+6 | No 7+6 car row | (same 4 open rows) |

### Plane format issues (3 — GeoGuessr confirmed but name format uncertain)

| Puzzle | Current city | Lengths | Row needed |
|--------|-------------|---------|------------|
| EPANASTROPHE | Derby, W. Australia | 5+9 or 5+7+9 | Row 14 (5+10+4)? Row 38 (5+5+9)? |
| LIGNIPERDOUS | Hasik, Oman | 5+4 | No match |
| ~~WINTERBOURNE~~ | ~~Tacurong, Philippines~~ | ~~8+11~~ | ~~Resolved: Row 64 as "Tacurong, The Philippines" (8+3+11)~~ |

### Stage 1 conflicts

| City | Row | Problem |
|------|-----|---------|
| ~~Kandi, Benin~~ | 75 | Cipher says R at pos 8, but Kandi gives I. Ruled out. |
| ~~Babylon, Iraq~~ | — | No 7+4 row exists. Superseded by Gaborone, Botswana (8+8 → row 8). |

## Notable Deductions

- **Row 54 = South Pole? (was Alofi, Niue):** Community intel (Feb 21) says South Pole from YouTube Short #2 (chocolate heart) replaces Alofi. Both fit 5+4 ending in E. South Pole has a known puzzle source; Alofi was deduced from grid pattern only.
- **Row 57 = undiscovered location:** Must be 5+5 with E at position 7 (2nd letter of word 2). No known Stage 1 destination fits. This is likely one of the ~8 unsolved Stage 1 puzzles.
- **Row 63 = Tampa Bay (not Tampa):** "TAMPA BAY FLORIDA" (5+3+7) fits row 63 with Silver-Boat=R at pos 12 (R in FLORIDA). Previously assumed "TAMPA FLORIDA" (5+7) which conflicted.
- **Seoul = row 28:** Format is "SEOUL SOUTH KOREA" (5+5+5), not "SEOUL KOREA" (5+5). Grid pattern change on Feb 20 confirmed this.
