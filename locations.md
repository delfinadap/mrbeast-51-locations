## Category 1: Playlist Setup (1 of 1)

*"The 1 puzzle that sets up the playlist."*

| # | Location | Puzzle | Decode | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1 | MAPUTO | Playlist setup puzzle | "**M**issing **A** **P**laylist? **U**se **T**his **O**ne:" — first letters spell MAPUTO (Maputo, Mozambique). Zero disputes across multiple servers. | Confirmed |

## Category 2: Screen + Bank Puzzles (9 of 12)

*"The 12 puzzles contained entirely in Sunday's commercial" + "The 12 puzzles in the bank video. Each goes with one of the screens."*

*Each screen in the computer lab pairs with one bank video puzzle (via BeastBot). One location per screen/bank pair.*

| Screen | Location | Screen Content | Bank Clue | Decode | Confidence |
|--------|----------|---------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | BENIN? | Backwards J ("> J̅ > ? N") | CEO Magazine (Benioff) | "Marc Benioff" = "mark BENI off" — scribbled section on screen is literally marking BENI off — visible N remains → BENIN. BeastBot hint: "read the magazine out loud" (phonetic). Backwards J and `>` signs unexplained. Multiple solvers converge independently. Country not city — could be Cotonou or Porto-Novo but no decode path to a specific city yet. | Unconfirmed |
| 2 | ??? | Trench coat pieces | Calendar dates (Jan 1, Feb 2, Mar 1, Mar 3, Jun 1, Jul 1, Aug 1, Aug 6, Sep 1, Nov 5, Dec 7). BeastBot confirmed: "the banker isn't American" — dates are DD/MM not MM/DD. No circled day >12 so the flip works. BeastBot also says look at "underscored numbers." | DD/MM flip + underscored numbers suggest more extraction needed | Unsolved |
| 3 | CAIRO | Can+Dylan+D rebus | Feastables shirt | Candyland color indexing on Feastables hoodie slogan → CAIRO. Community "certain." | Confirmed |
| 4 | KOMI REPUBLIC? | Sine wave | Withdrawal slip (routing 650283979, acct 5480234354, Feb 5) | BeastBot to Pieup: sine wave "has something to do with the withdrawal slip." Coordinate theory: 65.0283979°N, 54.80234354°E → Komi Republic, Russia. Remote taiga, no city at exact point, but region-level answers exist in puzzle (cf. Tierra del Fuego, Queensland). | Probable |
| 5 | **ANKARA** | Spider + Ballerina | Parking ticket #1268621-6 + "No Parking Your Tank at the Bank" signs | BeastBot hint: "look for what words have in common." Ballerina in **ARABESQUE** + spider = **ARACHNID** → shared = **ARA**. Signs say **TANK** at the **BANK** → shared = **ANK**. ARA+ANK = **ANKARA**. Only theory matching the BeastBot hint. Explains why ballerina is specifically in arabesque pose. | Confirmed |
| 6 | **TBILISI?** | Bird on wire | Coffee cup / bird toy | Screen birds use **bird cipher** → spells **DINAMO**. Bank bird toy points to coffee cup showing "Macon Coffee" with **outline of Georgia** — Georgia the country, not US state. DINAMO + Georgia → **FC Dinamo Tbilisi** (Georgia's most famous soccer club). Two puzzle elements converge from multiple sources. Weakness: Dinamo Batumi is also Georgian. No BeastBot confirmation. | Probable |
| 7 | **CEBU?** | Ear with T crossed out (5 blanks, T in pos 2 X'd) | IPESIT plate / "Talk Like a Pirate Day" sign | IPESIT → anagram → STEP II → Roman numeral → SEP 2 → remove T sound (ear+crossed T) → say aloud → **"CEBU"** (Philippines). Only theory using ALL 4 elements (plate, pirate sign, ear/audio, T-removal). BeastBot confirms both "License Plate" and "Pirate" trigger Screen 7. Phonetic leap debated ("Sep Two" → "Seh-boo"). | Probable |
| 8 | TIJUANA | Caesar busts (1,7,7,1,1,4,2,7,6,5,3) | "Best Bank" poster | Caesar bust numbers play **Slack Boop Plus** ringtone → Slack message "Attention: Valued Customers" → points to celebrities poster with **"THE BEST BANK"** → Caesar cipher on "THE BEST BANK" = **"SALAD ORIGIN"** → origin of **Caesar salad** = **Tijuana, Mexico** (Caesar Cardini, 1924). Triple Caesar pun (busts→cipher→salad). Multiple independent solvers. | Confirmed |
| 9 | ??? | Image carousel (swing, witch, elephant, swan pediment, sword, Swiss flag, sweater) | Crosswalk symbols (mirror to "DICE"?) | **Genuinely unsolved.** All carousel words start with **SW** — confirmed by Lone Shark Facebook post with underlined S+W. Portmanteau theory: swing+witch=SWITCH, elephant+pediment=ELEMENT → instruction to manipulate crosswalk. Progress bar goes up for 4 images, down for 3. No location extracted yet. | Unsolved |
| 10 | **BASEL?** | 10⁵ (0 underlined) | Sudoku (onemil.xyz) | **Genuinely unsolved — likely collaboration-gated.** Case #271829 = e × 10⁵ (Euler's number). BeastBot: "likely a wordoku." Hint #7 hidden acrostic = "MY BIO" → Euler's biography → **BASEL, Switzerland** (birthplace, ~20%). Underlined 0 may change interpretation. Hint #7: "you need friends, maybe a million of them" = reaching puzzle #1,000,000 collectively? | Unsolved |
| 11 | LINCOLN? | Top hat on weight (22.493 lbs) | Penny jar | 22.493 lbs of pennies ≈ $40.81 = latitude of Lincoln, Nebraska. Top hat = Abe Lincoln. But: penny math is approximate (22.493 lbs → 4089.6 pennies, not clean 4081). Multiple community members question whether the math is clean enough. | Probable |
| 12 | MOSCOW? | n³ = n² | Red Rubik's cube | n=0 or n=1 (binary). Red + Cube = Red Square, Moscow. | Probable |

## Category 3: Non-Screen Commercial Puzzles (9 of 12)

*"The 12 puzzles contained entirely in Sunday's commercial." (Hint #6). Visual elements in the commercial that are NOT on the 12 lab screens. Exactly 12 per Hint #6.*

| Location | Puzzle | Decode | Confidence |
|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| ACCRA | Vault door Scrabble | Scrabble tile values → words → underlined letters → "He funded hospital in site of last Scrabble Championship" | Confirmed |
| KABUL | Morse code light | Light flashes Morse code backwards = KABUL | Confirmed |
| ARLES | Laser pattern | Laser sequence hitting holes spells "LASER MIX UP" → anagram → ARLES | Confirmed |
| KUPANG | Clipboard overlay | Overlay BTS checklist with video frame → "Capital of East Nusa Tenggara" | Confirmed |
| LAHORE | Periodic dots overlap | Two dot patterns overlaid → row lengths → atomic numbers → periodic table → LA HO RE PA K I S TA N | Confirmed |
| LIMA | Belt wire colors | Color code 12-7-13-1 = L-I-M-A | Confirmed |
| TASHKENT? | Marked bills / Cash Pile | Red-rimmed bills sum → A1Z26 = "CASH TENT" → Tashkent. BeastBot: "numbers are underscored" — may be incomplete. | Probable |
| TALLINN | Subtitles / transcript | Hyphens adjacent to letters spell "Seven Letter Big Lodge" → "big lodge" = "tall inn" = TALLINN | Confirmed |
| NEW ORLEANS? | Tank numbers + "I scream" | Tank numbers match receipt from MrBeast "$100K Ice Cream" video. Ice cream type is from New Orleans. | Probable |
| ??? | Smoke grenade | BeastBot confirms this is a puzzle. No solve yet. | Unsolved |
| ??? | Camel/llama | BeastBot confirms, points to Saudi Arabia/BEASTLAND. No location extracted. | Unsolved |
| ??? | *Unidentified* | 12th commercial puzzle not yet found. | Unsolved |

## Category 4: Gift Puzzles (10 of 10)

*"The 10 gifts given out to our friends."*

| # | Location | Recipient | Decode | Confidence |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | DIVO | Jack McKenna | Card trick → DIVO, Côte d'Ivoire | Confirmed |
| 2 | BUFFALO | Botez Sisters | Chess Game 6 cipher → BUFFALO | Confirmed |
| 3 | TIERRA DEL FUEGO | Quackity | Sword with text + Beagle Channel | Confirmed |
| 4 | DEKALB | Hayleybaylee | Rings puzzle → DeKalb, Illinois | Confirmed |
| 5 | WICHITA, KS? | Jimmy Fallon | Jigsaw → "JIMMYS BIRTHPLACE." New BeastBot hint: "Sometimes a present is more reflective of the **giver** rather than the recipient." Jimmy = MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson), born in Wichita, KS — not Fallon. Retrocraft updated Feb 18. | Probable |
| 6 | CAIRNS, QUEENSLAND | Chris Hemsworth | "LAND OF CAIRNS" → Queensland. US 101 road signs + first letters. Confirmed by multiple sources. | Confirmed |
| 7 | TAMPA BAY | Sketch | "Angry Lair" → "Mad Den" → Madden 99 → BUCS HOME → Tampa Bay. Competing with DUBAI (coordinates). | Probable |
| 8 | COPENHAGEN | Pierson | Blender food combos → missing letters spell HAFNIUM CITY → Latin for Copenhagen | Confirmed |
| 9 | ALGIERS | Airrack | 7 pictures each hide "ERIC." First letters: A-L-G-I-E-R-S / A-L-G-E-R-I-A | Confirmed |
| 10 | VALENTINE, AZ? | Jim & Monika | Heart hoodie — 8 hearts replace O's in romantic words. Heart-binary method: hearts as 1/0 → decodes to "AZ." Valentine, Arizona is famous for its Valentine's Day postmark (fitting for a couple's gift). Novel theory from [Serious MrBeast Scavenger Hunters](https://discord.gg/KCtjNMJeYv). Not seen in other communities. | Probable |

---

## Category 5: Gift Unifier (0 of 1)

*"The 1 puzzle that unites them."*

*Previously attributed to the onemil.xyz Sudoku, but that's incorrect — BeastBot explicitly links the Sudoku to Screen 10 ("This bank video puzzle goes with screen 10"), making it a Screen+Bank puzzle (Category 2). The Gift Unifier is a separate, unidentified puzzle that somehow connects the 10 gift puzzles.*

| # | Location | Puzzle | Decode | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1 | ??? | Unknown — not the Sudoku | Must connect the 10 gift recipients/locations somehow. No candidates identified. | Unsolved |

---

## Category 6: YouTube Shorts / TikTok (1 of 2)

*"The 2 puzzles on YouTube shorts that aren't related to the gifts." Hint #6 updated to include TikTok.*

| # | Location | Video | Notes | Confidence |
|---|----------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **QUITO, Ecuador** | "Mirror mirror on the wall" (8_aIjKi0VLM) | 5 red items → phonetic syllables: RED key (KEY) + RED jersey numbers 15,20,23 A1Z26=OTW→TOW + RED "HECK" (bear/Codey) + RED £ pound on boxer (QUID) + RED doors (DOOR) = **KEY-TOW-HECK-QUID-DOOR** → "Quito Ecuador." BeastBot confirms cow, bear, and red doors as puzzles. Multiple independent solvers across community servers including [Serious MrBeast Scavenger Hunters](https://discord.gg/KCtjNMJeYv). | Confirmed |
| 2 | ??? | Chocolate heart (XbaZ45LVzzM) | MrBeast + Amaury Gaichon. Connected to Jim/Monika heart theme. TikTok version may differ from YouTube. | Unsolved |

## Category 7: Salesforce Site/Social (2 of 9)

*"The 9 puzzles you'll find on this site or social posts from Salesforce properties."*

*Biggest gap in the puzzle. Hint #9 (Feb 17) gave us the definitive breakdown of where to find all 9. 2 solved (Yellowknife, Nazaré). 5 puzzles confirmed via community, 2 likely, 2 still unidentified.*

### Hint #9 Structure (confirmed):
- **4 in BTS videos:** 2 underwater, 1 in pieces, 1 never forgets
- **3 on large physical objects** visible on Salesforce's X feed (1 may take a while to watch)
- **2 on this site:** 1 in a helpful video, 1 follows our advice

### Group A: 4 in BTS Videos

| # | Location | Puzzle | Hint #9 Match | Notes | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|-------|------------|
| A1 | ??? | **Malcolm in Water** | "2 underwater" (1st) | "MALCOM" triggers BeastBot. Vigenere cipher → "CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK KEEP DECODING..." Connected to submarine on briefcase. | Puzzle confirmed, unsolved |
| A2 | ??? | **Submarine Math** | "2 underwater" (2nd) | BTS video ~3:17. Independently identified by multiple teams. Details sparse. | Puzzle confirmed, unsolved |
| A3 | YELLOWKNIFE | **Puzzle Maker** | "1 in pieces" | Slack message at 6:19 in BTS video. Confirmed solved by multiple teams. | **Confirmed** |
| A4 | **THANE, India?** | **Elephant 85673** | "1 never forgets" | 85673 indexes into ELEPHANT: 8=T, 5=H, 6=A, 7=N, 3=E → **THANE**. Major city (1.9M pop) in Maharashtra, India. Twitter @ELEPHANT85673 confirmed fake (Hint #10), but 85673 appears independently in BTS content. Multiple solvers converged independently. | Probable |

### Group B: 3 on Large Physical Objects (Salesforce X Feed)

| # | Location | Puzzle | Hint #9 Match | Notes | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|-------|------------|
| B1 | **NAZARÉ, Portugal** | **Salesforce Tower LED video** | "1 may take a while to watch" | 17-min video on Salesforce X. Tower LEDs alternate gray/blue. Blue durations in seconds → A1Z26 = **"SURF RECORD SITE WITH ARGENT HUE."** "Surf record site" = Nazaré (Guinness World Record largest wave). "Argent" = silver; Nazaré is on Portugal's Silver Coast. Gray gaps ~15s (letter space), ~30s (word break). Multiple solvers converged. | **Confirmed** |
| B2 | DIMTU, Ethiopia? | **Billboard** | (2nd large object) | Vault billboard on Salesforce X with numbers **04 09 13 20 21** → A1Z26 = **D-I-M-T-U** → Dimtu, Ethiopia. Separately, Lone Shark "Where's the money" billboard has **E-M-O-N** underlined → MENTONE, AL theory. EMON may be a different layer. Neither confirmed by BeastBot. | Unconfirmed |
| B3 | ??? | **???** | (3rd large object) | **Unidentified.** Multiple solvers can't find a third large physical object. Pyramid from Salesforce video suggested but uncertain. | Not found |

### Group C: 2 on the Site

| # | Location | Puzzle | Hint #9 Match | Notes | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|-------|------------|
| C1 | ??? | **Dot-Dollar / "How?" video** | "1 in a helpful video" | Identified by multiple teams but unsolved. Likely the "How to Play" or similar help video on mrbeast.salesforce.com. | Puzzle confirmed, unsolved |
| C2 | ??? | **FAQ** | "1 follows our advice" | BeastBot confirmed: "FAQs are necessarily a puzzle." Lone Shark Shane shared direct link. References naval signals (semaphore?). | Puzzle confirmed, unsolved |

### Additional Candidates (not confirmed as one of the 9, may belong to other categories)

| Location | Puzzle | Source | Notes | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| CASABLANCA | **Slack emoji** | Slack messages | Emoji → CA-SA-BL-AN-CA. BeastBot confirms. Slack is a Salesforce product, but not clearly one of Hint #9's 9. May belong to a different category. | **Confirmed** (location), category uncertain |
| CHICAGO? | **BTS clocks** | BTS lobby photo | Four clocks: Tokyo, London, Chicago, New York. Likely set dressing — not one of the 4 BTS video puzzles per Hint #9. | Probably not a puzzle |
| ??? | **Cow** | YouTube Short ("Mirror Mirror") + BeastBot | BeastBot confirms as clue. Cow with red key, tag "40576." Appears in YouTube Short → probably Category 6, not Category 7. | Puzzle confirmed, wrong category? |
| ??? | **Bear (Codey)** | YouTube Short + Salesforce branding | BeastBot confirms. Salesforce mascot. Sign says "HECK." Same issue as Cow — appears in YouTube Short. | Puzzle confirmed, wrong category? |
| ??? | **Flamethrower** | BTS page (flickering video) | BeastBot confirms. Flickering encodes: **11 6 2 12 4 7 8 13 7 3 13 11 8 9 7 12 1 11 9 4**. Could be one of the BTS video puzzles or a physical object. Category unclear. | Puzzle confirmed, category uncertain |
| ??? | **Lock** | Salesforce site (Verify Lock UI) | "Verify Lock" with numbers. Almost entirely unexplored. Could be one of the "2 on this site." | Unconfirmed |
| ??? | **Salesforce Tower** | Slack messages + BTS | Tower appears in Slack and BTS. Chicago tower "has a lot of 3s." May overlap with B1 (tower video). | Unconfirmed |
| ??? | **Wanna Win a Million** | Unknown | Listed on community trackers but zero analysis. | Unconfirmed |

## Category 8: Lone Shark Socials (3 of 3)

|---|----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | HEARD ISLAND | Bluesky | Homophones indexed by word lengths → HEARD ISLAND. | Confirmed |
| 2 | ILE DE LA POSSESSION | Podcast (Hello Puzzlers) | "ISASEEDSESLIAOPNO" anagrams to ILE DE LA POSSESSION. | Confirmed |
| 3 | ASCENSION ISLAND | Facebook / BoardGameGeek | Last digit of each BGG ranking → index into title/description → acrostic. "Ascension" is also a card game name in the list. Text references "climbing" + "rising" (= ascending). All 3 Lone Shark answers are remote islands. | Confirmed |

---

## Category 9: Crossword (1 of 1)

*"And, of course, 1 crossword puzzle, which also sets up stage 2."*

| # | Location | Decode | Confidence |
|---|----------|--------|------------|

|----------|-------|
| DUBAI | Sketch gift alternative — coordinates 25°18'N, 55°18'E. Competing with Tampa Bay. |
| BASEL | Screen 10 (Sudoku/Euler) candidate. Euler's birthplace. "MY BIO" hidden acrostic in Hint #7 supports this. ~20% confidence. |
| RIYADH | Camel/Llama (commercial) — BeastBot confirmed as puzzle. "BEASTLAND" background = Saudi Arabia. |
| OKHA | Elephant named "Okha." Town in Gujarat. Twitter ELEPHANT85673 had encoded messages. |

## Key Hints Reference

### Hint #7 (Feb 15)
> One clue tells you to inquire with Slackbot about a specific kind of number puzzle.
> If you do that in a Puzzle Card, you'll get a place to look.
> But you'll always get the same one.
> You need friends for this puzzle.
> Maybe a million of them.

- "MY BIO" acrostic (first letters bottom-to-top).
- MrBeast YouTube bio says "I counted to 100k" → sudoku #100,000 may be key.

### Hint #8 (Feb 16)
> Take your 50 locations and your crossword to Beast Travel and go on many a wild vacation!
> The world is at your fingertips!
> Adventure is out there!
>
> If you're ready to check in, then your endgame is near.

### Hint #9 (Feb 17)
> Speaking of the number 9, we said there were 9 puzzles on this site or social posts from Salesforce properties.
> These are not connected to the commercials or these hints. They're in these places:
> 4 are in Behind the Scenes videos. 2 of those are underwater. 1 is in pieces. 1 never forgets.
> 3 are on large physical objects. You can see them on Salesforce's X feed. 1 may take a while to watch.
> 2 are on this site. 1 is in a helpful video. The other follows our advice.
> If you haven't found those, find those.

**Hint #9 mapping to puzzles:**
- 2 underwater → Malcolm in tank + Submarine Math (BTS video 3m17s)
- 1 in pieces → Puzzle Maker (→ YELLOWKNIFE, solved)
- 1 never forgets → Elephant 85673
- 3 large physical objects on Salesforce X → billboards/signs
- 1 helpful video → "How?" video = Dot-Dollar puzzle
- 1 follows advice → FAQ page (BeastBot confirmed)

## beast.travel (Stage 2 Site)

**URL:** https://beast.travel/ — confirmed Lone Shark Games production.

**Structure:** 3 trip categories (Car, Horse, Plane) with 20 destination names (7 car, 5 horse, 8 plane + more coming). Each page has: tagline (cryptic clue indicator), Lords of Vegas game piece carousel (6 colors), and destination cards with puzzle images.

| Page | Destination | Caption | Solve | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|--------|
| Car | BARODYNAMICS | "Join us at" | **CASPER, Wyoming?** — "Oil City" is Casper's nickname. Rebus: OIL CAN+SICK-K+TEA = OIL CITY. | Probable |
| Car | EBULLIOSCOPE | "See lovely" | **ARZAMAS, Russia** — image shows ~33 churches; Arzamas = "city of 33 churches." | Probable |
| Car | FURFURACEOUS | "Meet us at" | **DAR ES SALAAM?** — "home of peace." Disputed — Hint 9 says "not its translation." | Disputed |
| Car | HAPAXANTHOUS | "You'll like" | **BAKU, Azerbaijan** — rebus: "city" + "winds" = "City of Winds" = Baku. Multiple independent solvers converged. | Confirmed |
| Car | HEKISTOTHERM | "Get down to" | **WINNIPEG, Canada** — rebus capital + jets/plains. Capital of Manitoba, Winnipeg Jets, coldest major city. | Probable |
| Car | INCLINOMETER | "Come to" | **SURAT, India?** — DIAMOND + ??? + "of" + INDIA = "Diamond City of India" = Surat. Multiple solvers converged. | Probable |
| Car | MARIMBAPHONE | "Head off to" | **MARQUETTE, Michigan?** — rebus: crown + sit + E = "Queen City" + "of the" + compass north = "Queen City of the North." Also suggested: Santiago (Philippines), Edinburgh. | Probable |
| Horse | ABERUNCATORS | "Vacation at" | **OKATO, New Zealand** | Confirmed |
| Horse | DEAMBULATORY | "Find us in" | **NOVA RUSSAS, Brazil** — cryptic breakdown → W3W coordinates. | Confirmed |
| Horse | FISSICOSTATE | "Have fun at" | **CESKE BUDEJOVICE, Czechia** — cryptic → W3W: towers.decoder.models. | Confirmed |
| Horse | LACHRYMIFORM | "Now booking" | **CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand** — cryptic → W3W: driven.hint.improving. | Confirmed |
| Horse | LAEVODUCTION | "Ride out to" | **CASTELO BRANCO, Portugal** — cryptic → W3W: dusts.enigma.desks. | Confirmed |
| Plane | ABOUTSLEDGES | "See you at" | **AMBANJA, Madagascar** — GeoGuessr confirmed via Otiv Mandroso bank. | Confirmed |
| Plane | ABSQUATULATE | "Such fun at" | **SAINT-PIERRE, SPM** — image matched to lighthouse, exact Maps location found. | Confirmed |
| Plane | ECTYPOGRAPHY | "Come visit" | **KRASNODAR, Russia** — image shows Krasnodar street with Russian signs. | Confirmed |
| Plane | ELEEMOSYNARY | "Chill at" | **TUCUMAN, Argentina** — Mercedes Sosa Theater. | Confirmed |
| Plane | EPANOSTROPHE | "Be well at" | **DERBY, Western Australia** — Derby Wharf on Jetty Road. | Confirmed |
| Plane | EXSANGUINOUS | "You'll love" | **MANAUS, Brazil** — GeoGuessr: near MUSA (Museu da Amazônia). | Confirmed |
| Plane | LAMPADEPHORE | "Go to" | **PUNE, India** — GeoGuessr: near Ohel David Synagogue. | Confirmed |
| Plane | LIGNIPERDOUS | "Now enjoy" | **HASIK, Oman** — GeoGuessr: near Natif Waterfalls. Exact GPS match confirmed. | Confirmed |

**Extraction method:** Taglines are cryptic clue indicators. Cryptic clues solve to words → **what3words (W3W) addresses** → locations.

**IATA Airport Code Grid (43/49 valid — statistically significant):** Each 12-letter word splits into four 3-letter groups. 88% are valid IATA codes (vs. 54% base rate). Almost certainly intentional. Full grid in [beast.travel page](beast-travel.md).

**Photo puzzles (separate layer):** Car photo puzzle → **REGINA** (Saskatchewan, Canada). Horse/Plane photo puzzles unsolved.

---

## Observations

- All confirmed answers are **city/place/region names** — not countries
- ~12 puzzles completely unsolved with no location candidate
- Calendar dates from teller's desk (Screen 2) are an unsolved data set — DD/MM confirmed
- Hint #6 confirms all Stage 1 clues are now out — 60 puzzles total
- 50-character submission limit confirmed (physical UI cap), but debate over whether answer is exactly 50 chars
- BeastBot is now retroactively replying on old puzzle cards with new clues (significant shift)
