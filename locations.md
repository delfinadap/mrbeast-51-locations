## Category 2: Screen + Bank Puzzles (9 of 12)

*"The 12 puzzles contained entirely in Sunday's commercial" + "The 12 puzzles in the bank video. Each goes with one of the screens."*

*Each screen in the computer lab pairs with one bank video puzzle (via BeastBot). One location per screen/bank pair.*

| Screen | Location | Screen Content | Bank Clue | Decode | Confidence |
|--------|----------|---------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **KANDI, BENIN** | Backwards J ("> J̅ > ? N") | CEO Magazine (Benioff) | NaughtyKatsuragi (Feb 22): `>J>` read backwards alphabetically = K, J, I → swap J for "and" → **K AND I** → **KANDI**. "Marc Benioff" → **BENIN**. BeastBot: "read the magazine out loud" (phonetic), "knowledge of the alphabet will help you here." **Grid fit: Row 57 (5+5), Gold-Boat=E at pos 7 → BENIN[2]=E ✓.** Supersedes Benin City (had no valid grid fit). | Confirmed |
| 2 | **SEOUL** | Trench coat pieces | Calendar dates | BeastBot: "coat has a name with 8 letters that can be rearranged." Coat = RAINCOAT → anagram → **CROATIAN**. "Mrs. Maybelle isn't from around here" = use Croatian calendar (month names). Index circled dates (DD/MM) into Croatian month names → S-e-o-u-l → **SEOUL**. | Confirmed |
| 3 | CAIRO | Can+Dylan+D rebus | Feastables shirt | Candyland color indexing on Feastables hoodie slogan → CAIRO. Community "certain." | Confirmed |
| 4 | **LOWER HUTT, NZ** | Sine wave | Withdrawal slip (routing 650283979, acct 5480234354, Feb 5) | BeastBot: "sine waves go up and down in a regular pattern" + "there are no 1's... typical for this puzzle type. But there are 0's, which would normally be highly problematic." Apply cosine pattern (−1,+1,...) to digits → no 0s/1s. T9 phone keypad decode. **BeastBot confirmed "its lower hutt"** (Feb 22). | Confirmed |

| 6 | **TBILISI** | Bird on wire | Coffee cup / bird toy | Screen birds use **bird cipher** → spells **DINAMO**. Bank bird toy points to coffee cup showing "Macon Coffee" with **outline of Georgia** — Georgia the country, not US state. DINAMO + Georgia → **FC Dinamo Tbilisi**. Two puzzle elements converge. **Grid fit: Row 68 (7+7), Green-Boat=S → TBILISI[6]=S ✓.** | Confirmed |

(1) Tank "towed" → homophone → **TOAD**. (2) IPESIT = "I Paid Everyone Stuck In Traffic" (MrBeast video) → **STUCK** → delete T → **SUCK**. (3) "Arrrr" (pirate) + Kansas → **ARKANSAS**. = **TOAD SUCK, ARKANSAS** (real place!). | Confirmed |

| 9 | **WINDSOR, ON?** | Image carousel (swing, witch, elephant, swan pediment, sword, Swiss flag, sweater) | Crosswalk symbols | All images start with **SW** (Lone Shark confirmed). BeastBot (Feb 22): "The pictures create directional lines which can pair with the lines that start in the middle of the crosswalk." → semaphore mechanism. Windsor, Ontario proposed but solve method doesn't yet use crosswalk. Grid row 16 (7+7), R at pos 7 ✓. | Unconfirmed |
| 10 | ??? | 10⁵ (0 underlined) | Sudoku (onemil.xyz) | **Genuinely unsolved — likely collaboration-gated.** Case #271829 = e × 10⁵ (Euler's number). Hint #7: "you need friends, maybe a million of them." | Unsolved |
| 11 | **DOHA, QATAR** | Top hat on weight (22.493 lbs) | Penny jar | 22.493 lbs pennies ≈ lat 40.81. BeastBot denied Lincoln: "take it one more step." **BeastBot confirmed DOHA, QATAR** (multiple community members, Feb 22). Grid row 76 (4+5), Purple-Boat=T at pos 7 → QATAR[3]=T ✓. | Confirmed |

## Hints #10 and #11

### Hint #10 (Feb 18)
These things are **NOT** puzzles: four clocks, Mike's bat shirt, tank insignia, random anagrams, any new X/YouTube accounts, the word "hopscotch," any other Roamy, and Red Herring Bank (it's a red herring).

### Hint #11 (Feb 19)
For beast.travel car trips: "Take them literally. When you get a city nickname, you don't need any extra words or inferences. Just find a place that uses that exact nickname (not the phrase as its name or translation)."

## beast.travel — Decoded Message (Vehicle-Color Cipher)

The boat page (91 rows) contains a **substitution cipher**: each vehicle icon (color + type) always replaces the same letter. This was verified across 50 of 51 confirmed destination rows with zero exceptions.

**Full decoded message (91 letters):**

> IN JIMMY'S VAULT, FIRST PART STICKS ROAMY RESULTS IN BETWEEN STAGE ONE ANSWER PAIRS. LAST PART HE SHOWED AT START.

**Interpretation:**
1. **FIRST PART:** Interleave ("stick") the beast.travel ("Roamy") results in between Stage One answer pairs
2. **LAST PART:** Something "he showed at the start" (beginning of commercial/video)

**Cipher key (26 vehicle-color combos → letters):**
- Boats: Brown=A, Gold=E, Green=S, Purple=T, Silver=R
- Cars: Black=Y, Blue=C, Green=B, Purple=M, Red=I, Yellow=U
- Horses: Black=K, Blue=D, Green=V, Purple=G, Red=H, Yellow=W
- Planes: Blue=J, Green=N, Purple=L, Red=O, Yellow=P
- Black-Plane=F (inferred)

**Status:** 88/91 rows placed (3 unknown: rows 67, 74, 75). Cipher verified across all placed rows with zero exceptions.
